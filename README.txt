A web application developed for three college subjects. In the app you can play the game "Like T-rex, only different." The repository contains the entire application project and, in addition, the game in python under the "T-rex" directory. The django_project directory contains the entire application. The project was created by Jan Kaminski.
The application created in the Django framework. In the application you can play the game "Like T-rex, only different." programmed in python, using open source pygame libraries. 
To start the project, activate the virtual environment with the command ".venvScriptsActivate.ps1", then enter the django_project directory with the command "cd \django_project" and start the server with the command "python manage.py runserver". Once the server is running, open a browser and open to http://127.0.0.1:8000/, or whatever port is free and django can occupy it.
